# Spreadsheet Viewer in Javascript

Creating a javascript exel and csv file viewer that is using a web interface.

This is a basic app, so in the case the spreadsheet has more then one sheet, it will only disply the first one.

Great when you wnat to look at the data and don't want to modify it, such when doing data analyses in python, exc.

Or in cases of a weak computer and wont to see a spreadsheet and work on the same time in the web.

Or if you don't have an office to work with.


## Tools Used

For deployment i used `vite`.

Written in vanilla JS.

Used to handle data from `csv` and `xlsx` files:

```bash
npm install xlsx
```
